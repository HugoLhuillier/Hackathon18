# Hackathon 2018 - Solution

This directory contains the solution to the hackathon.

- `base.R` loads the required packages and the three main data samples
- the other `R` files contain functions that, when called with the appropriate data, reproduce the corresponding figure / table in Heathcote, Perri & Violante (2009)
- `solution.Rmd` shows the output of these functions

You need to put the `/data` directory for these files to run.
